### Description

R is a scripting language often used for data processing in humanities and social sciences. It provides the means to produce analyses as a reproducible workflow that is transparent to readers and easy to update. We will start with the very basics of R and RStudio, and quickly work our way through to simple data processing via tidyverse packages. Tidyverse is a set of packages that aims to make R easy to use especially for beginners. We will learn 1) basic R syntax, 2) reading data into R, 3) selecting data points and features, 4) making quick summaries of data, 5) creating variables, 6) transforming data and data frames, 7) joining datasets together.

This is a very practical introduction to R. We will focus more on how to do these things in R, and less on the research questions that drive these needs. All the data processing is done in tidyverse, so if you know R but not tidyverse, it may be interesting for you too.

We will rely on personal laptops in this tutorial, you will need to install R (https://www.r-project.org) and RStudio  (https://www.rstudio.com) a few days beforehand. Short instructions will be shared.

If you have no previous experience in R, this tutorial is a requirement for attending other workshops using R in this summer school.
